This RST content starts with the "Add a Web Account User" section and ends with the document details up to "Create a Document Category," as requested. Let me know if you need the rest of the document converted or any assistance with the rest of its parts.

Based on the initial extraction of the document titled "Segment_5.pdf", the text layout includes headlines, steps, and references to figures, similar to a manual or guide. The first extracted page contains information about how to add an activity online and mentions figures with numbers (e.g., Figure 68).

Below is a conversion of this segment into RST format up to what is visible. Please note that the content might require adjustments for complete accuracy and formatting, as the text extraction might not perfectly capture the document's layout:
